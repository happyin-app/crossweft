# Changelog

## 0.2.1 (2026-10-10)

- New transform `go-http-status`: a Go `net/http` status constant name
  (`StatusTooManyRequests`) becomes its number (`429`), so the statuses a Go
  handler writes can be compared with the numeric statuses a client in another
  language accepts. The table is Go's `net/http/status.go`; an unknown name stays
  as it is and never matches a number, so a guard reading it fails instead of
  passing.
- A join point takes `within` (one capture group), like a set side: the point
  reads only those regions, e.g. the default block of a file that also documents
  an alternative value. Every match inside the regions still counts, so a drifted
  copy inside cannot hide. The regex runs on the whole file (not on a slice)
  and only matches lying wholly inside a region count, so `^`, `$`,
  lookbehind and lookahead see the real text; a
  `within` that finds no region fails as `anchor:join:<id>:within:<path>`.
- `engine.Checker.route_registrations(text, function_prefixes, unscannable=None)`:
  the go-chi route enumerator `check` uses, as a side-effect-free classmethod,
  so a joint-kind plugin that needs the server's routes reuses it instead of
  keeping a second scanner. Registrations it cannot name go to the optional
  callback.
- Docs: install by the release commit in CI (tag in a comment). A tag can be
  moved and would change what CI runs.

## 0.2.0 (2026-10-08)

- `crossweft impact` on files that are on no block says so and how to map them,
  instead of the generic "fix the other sides" advice; without paths outside a
  git work tree it exits 2 with one sentence instead of git's `--no-index` usage.
- `check --format sarif`: the `crossweft/model` and `crossweft/render` results
  now carry `partialFingerprints` too (rule plus normalised error text; one
  key for stale generated docs), so API uploads do not duplicate alerts.
  `check --format json` (or `--json`) with an unreadable `crossweft.json`
  prints the normal json document with `"ok": false` and exit 2 instead of
  plain text; `--changed` with `--format sarif` is still refused, now on
  stderr with an empty stdout.
- Every subcommand's `--help` now has a description and an example, and every
  flag a help line. New [docs/cli.md](docs/cli.md) documents every command and
  flag; this repository's own check fails when a command or flag is missing
  from the docs or documented without existing.
- The AGENTS.md block and the `crossweft` skill now cover the exit codes
  (2 is never a pass), `check --changed` as a pre-commit check only, the MCP
  tools, `import`, `baseline` as adoption-only, and what
  `attest --other-side-unchanged` claims. After upgrading, `crossweft check`
  reports the harness as out of date until you re-run `crossweft agents`.
- README: a quick start (init --example, break, fix, map, CI), the exit codes,
  and archagent, GitNexus contracts and Erode in the comparison.
- A join point's `side` must be non-empty, and a `side` that is a block id must
  name a block that holds the point's file (it, a part of it or a block
  containing it); otherwise a schema error names the owning block(s). Free
  labels stay valid -- `side` never decided which end a file is on.
- `check --changed` no longer rescans every route file when one changed: a
  changed client file reads only the changed client files, a changed router
  rescans the routers (every one, so `route:unserved` stays exact) and no
  client file. Path containment checks list each directory once instead of
  resolving every file. Synthetic 40-service repo: `--changed` on a client
  file 96 s -> 23 s, on a router 316 s -> 28 s, full check 289 s -> 182 s.
- `crossweft mcp`: a read-only MCP server on stdio (stdlib only) with the tools
  `check`, `impact`, `show`, `discover` and `other_side`; a call without a verdict
  is an `isError` result, a bad argument a JSON-RPC error.
- README opens with a plain one-sentence description and a glossary of the ten
  terms the rest of it uses.
- `crossweft init --example`: also writes a tiny working seam (a Python and a
  TypeScript constant, two blocks, a link, a join) so `crossweft check` passes
  at once, and fails naming the other file when one value changes. Refuses if
  `crossweft-example/` already exists; nothing is written then.
- `crossweft discover` with nothing to suggest prints a ready-to-edit
  blocks + link + join snippet instead of asking to confirm candidates.
- The model `init` writes points at the field reference by https URL instead of
  a `docs/` path that does not exist in your repository.
- A join point whose regex matches nothing is reported under `joins` (it was
  `anchors`) and shows the regex as written, not JSON-escaped. Its key is
  unchanged (`anchor:join:<id>:<path>`), so findings that name it still apply.
- A current link missing `from_anchors`/`to_anchors` now shows the expected
  shape, e.g. `"from_anchors": [{"path": "<file>", "find": "<text in that file>"}]`.
- `crossweft import openapi|proto <schema> --against <file> [--link <id>]`: prints
  ready-to-paste `sets`/`joins` for a seam whose one side is an OpenAPI 3.x (JSON
  only) or .proto schema; every regex is tried on both files first, and a side
  that matched nothing is marked and left out. Exit 0 / 1 (nothing matched) / 2
  (schema unreadable).
- Native route scanners `express` (with Fastify), `fastapi`, `flask`, `gin` and
  `echo`: groups, mounted/included routers and blueprints with literal prefixes
  are followed in the file; parameters are reported as `{name}`; a non-literal
  path, method or prefix, or a router handed in from elsewhere, is
  `route:unscannable:...` (or declared in the new `receivers`); a native router
  file with nothing scanned is `route:scan-empty:<file>`; `router_search` now
  reports unscanned routers of every supported kind, not only chi.
- `check --changed REV`: runs only the guards that read a file changed since
  REV (plus untracked and git-ignored files) and says so
  (`SCANNED ... (changed-only: N of M guards)`); a changed map, lock, config or
  joint plugin, or an unreadable change set, runs the full check instead. A
  finding whose guard was skipped is reported as not re-checked, never stale.

## 0.1.0 -- first public release

- License: Apache-2.0.
- Public name: Crossweft (`crossweft` package, command and plugin).
- `check --format sarif`: SARIF 2.1.0 for code scanning. Each problem carries
  its key as a partial fingerprint; recorded findings are suppressed results;
  an unreadable model is a failed invocation, not an empty run. Exit codes are
  those of `check`.
- `crossweft baseline --owner --next-step`: adopt in a repository with existing
  drift by recording every current problem as open findings (one per
  category). New drift still fails; each finding goes stale once fixed.
  Problems a finding cannot excuse are refused; an existing file is never
  overwritten.
- `attest` refuses when only some regions of a pair changed since the last
  attestation (the twin was not touched); `--other-side-unchanged` states that
  the twin was re-read and is already equivalent.
- A model that fails schema validation exits 2 with `RESULT: ERROR` (it was
  exit 1 with `RESULT: FAIL (new=0 ...)`), as documented: nothing was checked.
- The stop hook's advice follows the kind of problem (value drift, moved
  anchor, unmapped route, incomplete map, unloadable model) and carries a
  ready-to-fill finding with the problem key.
- `show` accepts the `kind:id` form that check, impact and hooks print
  (including a problem key) and suggests close ids on a miss; `check --help`
  lists the exit codes.
- Input integrity: reject duplicate JSON keys, missing set inputs, ambiguous
  paths and transforms that collapse distinct members.
- Findings identify the exact disagreement, so accepting known drift cannot
  silently accept a later different disagreement in the same guard.
- Go chi scanning covers `Method`/`MethodFunc`, raw strings and normalized
  paths; a two-sided guard must read two distinct component ends.
- Validator timeouts stop the subprocess tree. Hook input is UTF-8; plugin
  launching does not rely on the caller's `PYTHONPATH` layout.
- Agent integration preserves unrelated hooks and reports an unrunnable or
  incomplete harness instead of treating it as successful enforcement.

- Model: blocks, links, flows, data, findings; every link declares
  `contract.enforcement`; hand-written seams need a guard that reads both sides.
- Guards: `join` (every occurrence compared), `set`, and `pair` (fingerprinted
  regions re-attested with a written reason).
- Value transforms for joins and sets: `unescape-c`, `lower`, `strip`,
  `csv-words`, `basename`.
- Checks: anchors, routes (Go chi and regex scanners), data provenance, status,
  coverage, findings that go stale when fixed; paths may never leave the
  repository.
- `crossweft impact`, `crossweft discover`, `crossweft render` (Markdown +
  Mermaid + interactive viewer, English and Russian).
- Agent hooks: Claude Code plugin (tested); Codex, Gemini CLI, Copilot, Cursor
  adapters (experimental).
- `crossweft agents` (run by `init`): the repository carries its own agent
  harness -- Claude Code hooks, an AGENTS.md block, the skill -- and `check`
  fails when it goes missing or out of date. The skill includes mapping a
  repository from scratch: agents write the map, the check keeps it honest.
- `crossweft validators`: a meta-runner that fails any validator that scanned
  nothing or lacks a real self-test.
- GitHub Action, pre-commit hooks, `--format github|json`.

### Joint-kind plugins

- A repository can add its own kinds of joint as plugins (`joints.dir` in
  `crossweft.json`, one `joints_<kind>.py` per kind): `check` runs them,
  `render` writes their pages and generated files, `impact` names the kinds a
  change feeds. `meta.joint_kinds` pins the kinds, so deleting a model file or
  a plugin fails the check instead of turning a gate off. A plugin that fails
  to import, crashes, returns a malformed result or compares nothing is a
  fatal problem, never a pass.
- Hardened after independent review: `sys.exit()` or any non-Ctrl-C
  `BaseException` in a plugin (import, validate, check, render, generated,
  impact, self_test) is a loud error, never an exit 0; generated paths must be
  normalised and may not touch `crossweft.json`, `model_dir`, `output_dir`, the
  lock file, `joints.dir` or the plugin itself (case-folded); modules a plugin's
  import added from its own directory are dropped afterwards, so they cannot
  shadow a host module; `crossweft self-test` runs each plugin's `self_test()`
  and says `joint plugins: none configured` when there are none; wrong-typed
  `problems`/`files`/`items`/`other` and a crash in `render_markdown` or
  `generated` are named errors, and a plugin's own problem with 0 items is
  reported as itself.
- `check` prints every failing problem, including one outside the listed
  categories (before, it was counted in the result but not shown).

### Hardened before release (independent review, 2026-09-30)

Each item below was reproduced first and has a test that failed before the fix.

- Keys: join and pair problems end in a digest of the disagreement
  (`join:api-version:b5dfb7e5`), so a finding excuses only that disagreement
  and a new one fails again.
- Silent passes closed: a repeated JSON key in config, model or lock file is an
  error; every listed set file and glob must yield a file, and a literal path
  containing `[` is read as that file; two files a transform folds into one
  member fail; a guard counts as reading both sides only with files of two
  different ends; go-chi `Method`/`MethodFunc`, raw strings and non-literal
  paths (`route:unscannable`) are seen; directories starting with `_` are
  covered.
- Model paths have one spelling (no `\`, `//`, `./`; wrong case fails), so
  `impact` matches what `check` accepts.
- A regex group that does not take part is no match, not a crash; `render`
  touches only files it generated; a non-UTF-8 file there is an error.
- "Scanned nothing" is an error in every output (`RESULT: ERROR`, JSON
  `ok: false`, a GitHub annotation); at Stop an empty model warns the user
  instead of sending the agent back.
- Route checks index routes by normalised path (2,000 routes: 29 s to under 1 s).
- Hooks: stdin is UTF-8; `crossweft hook` never exits 2, and a hook this
  version does not know is skipped with exit 1 (visible, not blocking); the
  plugin stays quiet only where the project's own hooks actually run; the
  launcher ignores `PYTHONPATH` and a `crossweft/` in the working directory.
- `crossweft agents` is idempotent with any `--command`, leaves other tools'
  hooks and shared groups alone, keeps line endings, indentation and non-ASCII
  text, writes atomically, respects `agent.harness: false`, and adds the
  `@AGENTS.md` import to `CLAUDE.local.md` too. `check` also fails on
  `disableAllHooks`, on a duplicate AGENTS.md block and on a `CLAUDE.local.md`
  that hides AGENTS.md.
- Validators: a timeout or Ctrl-C kills the whole process tree; the report is
  ASCII-safe. `discover --limit` must be at least 1; the Action passes `root`
  through the environment.
