"""`crossweft validators` -- run every validator and PROVE each did real work.

The motivating defect class: a validator can silently become a no-op -- a path
bug makes it scan 0 inputs and print a vacuous "[OK]", and the gate "passes"
precisely because it never ran. Each validator should self-guard (fail loud when
it scans nothing); this meta-runner is the OUTER guard and the wiring point: it
discovers every `validate_*.py` in the configured directory and, for each,
enforces four contracts:

  1. It HAS a `--self-test`, that self-test exits 0, AND its output carries a
     `SELF-TEST: checks=<n>` line with n > 0 -- proof the self-test path ran
     (a validator that merely mentions the flag would otherwise run its normal
     path and "pass" its self-test).
  2. On a normal run it exits 0 (no findings) -- a non-zero normal exit is a
     real finding and fails the suite.
  3. Its normal-run stdout contains a `SCANNED: files=<n> items=<n>` line with
     at least ONE count > 0 -- i.e. it provably examined real inputs.
  4. It finishes within its timeout (a timeout is a FAIL row, never a crash).

If any contract breaks, the suite FAILS (exit 1).

A validator may also be legitimately NOT APPLICABLE to the checkout it is
standing on (e.g. a release-only check running on a development branch). It
declares that by printing `APPLICABILITY: <reason>` on its normal run, and this
runner reports that row as **SKIP** -- never as PASS, because no real work was
proved. A skip excuses NOTHING: all three contracts above are evaluated first,
so an `APPLICABILITY:` line cannot mask a non-zero exit, a `SCANNED files=0
items=0`, a missing `SCANNED:` line, or a missing/failing `--self-test`. The
skip must also name its reason -- a bare `APPLICABILITY:` FAILS, since a skip
nobody can read is a silent one.

Wire this into CI (and pre-commit), so a broken / no-op validator surfaces on
every PR instead of silently protecting nothing.

Validators are evaluated CONCURRENTLY (bounded thread pool) because each one is
almost entirely spent waiting on child interpreters, not on this process. That
is a scheduling change only: the reported table, the summary and the exit code
are byte-identical to a strictly serial run, because results are collected in
DISCOVERY order (sorted by validator name) and never in completion order. Each
validator writes only into its own private temp tree, so two of them cannot
collide; `CROSSWEFT_JOBS=1` forces strictly-serial execution if that ever
stops being true. An unparseable CROSSWEFT_JOBS is an error, not a default.

Usage:
    crossweft validators                      # dir from crossweft.json validators.dir
    crossweft validators --dir scripts/validators
    crossweft validators --self-test          # proves the runner catches a no-op
    CROSSWEFT_JOBS=1 crossweft validators     # force strictly serial

ASCII-only output (Windows cp1252 safe). Exit 0 = every validator either ran
real work and passed or declared itself not applicable (reported as SKIP, and
counted separately in the closing summary); exit 1 = at least one failed / did
nothing / lacks a self-test.
