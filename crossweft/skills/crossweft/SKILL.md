description: Work safely in a repository that declares its cross-component seams with crossweft (it has a crossweft.json). Use when editing code that another component depends on -- routes, headers, protocol versions, DTO fields, env vars, pipe names, duplicated algorithms -- when `crossweft check` fails, when adding a new seam or guard to the map, or when attesting a changed pair.

# Working in a crossweft repository

## Codex plugin behavior

When this skill is installed through the Crossweft Codex plugin, it is a
skill-only integration. It does not register Codex hooks: before a
cross-component edit, run `crossweft impact <path>` yourself, and before
concluding the task, run `crossweft check`. Do not add a Codex hook
configuration from this skill; Crossweft publishes automatic hooks only where
their command-hook contract is verified.

A **seam** is a place where two components must agree: a route the client calls
and the server registers, a header, a protocol version, the fields of a DTO,
the env vars a service reads, the same rounding rule in two languages. The map
in `model_dir` (see `crossweft.json`) declares every seam and **how** its two
sides are kept in agreement (`contract.enforcement`). Hand-written seams
(`duplicated`, `convention`, `none`) each have a **guard** that reads both
sides: a `join` (a value must be equal), a `set` (members must match) or a
`pair` (two regions are fingerprinted and re-attested after a change).

## Before and after you edit

1. Before changing a file that may be one side of a seam, run
   `crossweft impact <path>`. It lists the links through that file, the file
   on the **other** side, and the guard that compares them.
2. Make the change on **both** sides. The hook (if installed) repeats this after
   every edit.
3. Run `crossweft check`. It must end with `RESULT: PASS` before you finish.
   Exit 0 = pass, 1 = problems (each with a key), 2 = no verdict (the config or
   model could not be read, or nothing was scanned) -- 2 is never a pass.

`crossweft check --changed HEAD` runs only the guards that read a changed file.
Use it as a fast pre-commit check, never as the final one: it cannot see drift
committed earlier, so finish with the full `crossweft check`.

If the repository configures the `crossweft mcp` server, its read-only tools
`impact`, `other_side`, `check`, `show` and `discover` answer the same
questions without a shell.

## When `crossweft check` fails

Every problem prints a `key`. Fix the cause, not the guard:

| Category | What it means | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `joins` | a value differs between sides (or between two places on one side) | make every place carry the same value |
| `sets` | a member exists on one side only | add it to the other side; an intentional difference goes into the set's `allow` list **with a reason** |
| `pairs` | a fingerprinted region changed since its last attestation | re-read every region of the pair, make them agree, then `crossweft attest <id> --reason "<what you compared>"`. If only one region changed, attest refuses: change the twin too, or -- only if you re-read it and it is already equivalent -- add `--other-side-unchanged` (it records that claim; it is not an override) |
| `routes` | the server registers a route no link declares, a link declares a route nobody serves, or the client calls an unmapped route | map the route in the link's `identifiers.route`, or remove the dead call |
| `anchors` | a literal the map points at moved or vanished | confirm the claim is still true, then update the anchor |
| `seams` | a link has no contract, or a hand-written seam has no guard | declare `contract.enforcement`; add a join/set/pair (`crossweft discover` suggests ready-made ones) |
| `provenance` / `status` | data leaves a block that never received it; a current link depends on a legacy block | fix the map or the code, whichever is wrong |
| stale finding | a recorded finding no longer reproduces | the problem is fixed: set the finding's `status` to `closed` with `closed_by` |

If the drift is real, intentional, and cannot be fixed in this change, record a
**finding** (in the model's `findings`) with the problem key in `detected_by`,
an `owner` and a `next_step`. The check then reports it as known; when someone
fixes it, the check itself asks to close the record.

`crossweft baseline --owner <who> --next-step "<what>"` records every current
problem as findings at once. It is for adopting crossweft in a repository that
already has drift, once the map is written -- never for silencing drift you
just introduced.

## Never

- Delete or weaken a guard, or widen a regex, just to make the check pass.
- Attest a pair without reading every region, or pass `--other-side-unchanged`
  to get past a refusal; the reason lands in the lock file and in review.
- Add an `allow` entry or a finding without a concrete reason, or run
  `crossweft baseline` to get past a failing check.
- Edit the generated files in `output_dir` by hand -- change the model and run
  `crossweft render`.

## Mapping a repository from scratch

The map is written by agents, not by hand; the check is what keeps an
agent-written map honest. Work in this order and let `crossweft check` drive
you -- every step below turns into problems it lists until the step is done.

1. `crossweft init` (skip if `crossweft.json` exists). Then set
   `meta.coverage.roots` to the source roots (`["src/*", "server/*"]`, ...):
   from now on `check` lists every directory that is not the code of any
   block. That list is your to-do list; the map is complete when it is empty.
2. **Blocks.** One per thing that runs, ships or stores on its own: a
   program, a service, a library, a database, a config file other code reads,
   an external API. `code` = its directories; `lane` = where it runs. Split
   where a boundary is real (a process, a language, a network hop), not by
   folder size.
3. **Links.** For every pair of blocks that talk: `transport`, and anchors on
   **both** ends -- `from_anchors`/`to_anchors` are literals that exist in the
   code (the check fails on any anchor it cannot find, so you cannot invent
   one). Put routes, headers, env vars and pipe names in `identifiers`.
4. **Enforcement, honestly.** `shared-code` only if both sides import one
   symbol, `generated` only if a generator writes both, `schema-tests` only
   if both run shared vectors -- and name it in `defined_in`. Everything
   typed twice by hand is `duplicated` or `convention`.
5. **Guards.** `crossweft discover` lists values already typed into two
   languages with ready-to-paste joins and sets. When one side is an OpenAPI
   (JSON) or .proto schema, `crossweft import openapi|proto <schema> --against
   <file> --link <id>` prints guards for its fields, enums, version and paths.
   Every hand-written seam needs one that reads a file on each side; use a
   `pair` for duplicated logic that has no value to compare.
6. **Routes.** If a block serves HTTP, add `meta.route_scan` so registered
   routes and client literals are compared with the links.
7. `crossweft check` until `RESULT: PASS`. A problem that is real drift in
   the code is a finding for the owner, not something to hide: fix it, or
   record it with an `owner` and `next_step` (`crossweft baseline` records
   all of them at once in an adoption).
8. `crossweft agents`, so every later session -- yours or another agent's --
   gets the hooks, this skill and the AGENTS.md rules automatically.

What a person should review: the enforcement of each link (is it really one
owner?), and the open findings. Everything else the check verifies.

## Adding a seam to the map

1. `crossweft discover` lists values already typed into two languages (routes,
   headers, versions, env vars) with a ready-to-paste `join`/`set` whose regexes
   were tried against the files; `crossweft import` does the same when one side
   is a schema.
2. Add the two blocks (if missing) and a link between them with
   `contract.enforcement`, `from_anchors` and `to_anchors`.
3. Add the guard with `"link": "<link id>"`. A guard must read a file on **each**
   side, or the check reports the seam as unguarded.
4. `crossweft check`, then `crossweft render` if the repository commits the
   generated docs.

Field reference: `docs/model-reference.md`; every command and flag:
`docs/cli.md` -- both in the crossweft repository.
